# 3D Equivariant Convolutional Neural Network
 
This repository implements a SE(3)-equivariant convolutional neural network using the [escnn](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn) library. The model is designed for processing 3D volumetric data with rotational equivariance, making it suitable for applications in physics
